# ROAD ACCIDENT ANALYSIS
![](Dashboard.png)
Complete Road Accident Analysis in M.S Excel

## Introduction
Road accidents remain a major global public safety issue, often resulting in significant social, economic, and health impacts. 
This project analyzes road accident data to uncover meaningful patterns, identify high-risk factors, and support data-driven decision-making for safer transportation systems.
The data provides insights into accident frequency, severity, types of vehicles involved, road conditions and more, helping to inform traffic safety measures and improvements.

## Project Goal
The goal is to provide actionable insights that could help traffic authorities and policy-makers improve road safety measures.
This analysis focuses on accident severity, the impact of weather conditions, road surface types, and
time-based trends. The final output includes an interactive dashboard allowing users to filter data by year, location, and vehicle type.

## Objectives 🎯
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
**Identify KPI Trends:** Analyze total casualties, total accidents, and fatality rates over time.
**Severity Analysis:** Determine the distribution of accidents by severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight).
**Environmental Impact:** Assess how weather (Rain, Snow, Fog) and road surface conditions affect accident frequency.
**Vehicle & Demographics:** Analyze the involvement of different vehicle types and casualty demographics.
**Vehicle Type Distribution:** Analyzes the types of vehicles involved in accidents.
**Road Surface and Type:** Understands how different road conditions (dry, wet, snow/ice) impact accidents.
**Urban vs. Rural:** Distinguishes accident trends based on whether the accident occurred in an urban or rural area.
**Monthly Trends:** Displays accident data by month to help identify seasonal patterns and spikes in accident numbers.
**Light Conditions:** Examines the impact of daylight and darkness on accident rates.
Build intuitive dashboards and visualizations to communicate insights.

## 🛠️ Methodology 

### 🧹 Data Preparation

Key preprocessing performed:
- Removed duplicates and inconsistent entries
- Standardized date/time formats
- Cleaned and normalized categorical fields
- Handled missing values
- Created computed fields (e.g., accident hour, severity categories)

### 📈 Tools & Techniques Used
- Microsoft Excel (sole analysis tool)
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts for analysis
- Power Query for dat cleaning
- Conditional Formatting
- Lookup Functions (VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP)
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Functions for derived metrics
- Data Visualization: Created an interactive Dashboard with Slicers and Timeline filters.
- Charts used: Donut Charts (Severity), Bar Charts (Casualties by Location), Line Charts (Trend over time), and Map Charts (Geographical distribution).

## 📊 Analysis & Key Insights

Some of the major insights derived include:
- Peak Accident Times: Higher accident frequency during evening rush hours.
- Road Surface: Dry road surface had the highest road accident and casualties.
- Day-of-Week Trends: Increased incidents on weekends/Fridays.
- Weather Conditions: Most accidents occurred under clear weather, suggesting human factors are dominant.
- Severity Analysis: Specific road types or intersections show higher severe-accident rates.
- Vehicle Type Patterns: Single carriageway followed by Dual carriageway leading.
- Area with urban leading.
- Visualizations created in Excel (pivot charts, bar charts, heat maps, etc.) help support each insight.

## Recommendations
- Introduce congestion-reduction measures in high-density urban zones.
- Implement smart traffic signals, improved pedestrian crossings, and speed-calming measures.
- Integrate protected lanes for cyclists and powered two-wheelers.
- Launch awareness campaigns addressing:Distracted driving, Speeding, Lane discipline, Urban pedestrian safety.
